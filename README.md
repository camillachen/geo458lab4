# Lab 4: Generating Map Tiles

## Map tile not showing up in leaflet map
I'm not sure why. I'm stuck on this problem for days, no matter what code I write, the tiles won't show up, but the map is displayed fine.

### The map and the Tiles

This is a map of the Chinatown Plaza in Chicago, Illinois. The tiles I've made in mapbox are polygons I've made of the stores and restaurants in the Chinatown Plaza. Unfortunately, most of the stores are not labeled online, so I cannot label some of the buildings.

The zoom level I selected is 18 because the Chiantown Plaza is a very specific part of a city, so its area is not that large. That's why I had to set the zoom very high.

For some reason, my tile and the polygons I've made in mapbox is not showing up in the map. I am not sure why, and I've tried so many different code. I can attach pictures of my QGIS and the original website that shows my tiles. My mapbox WMTS link is [this](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/camillachen/cka3bson8096w1inwzdoeaf35/wmts?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiY2FtaWxsYWNoZW4iLCJhIjoiY2thMjBnMGNkMDcxYTNscGo4djJ3dGg4MCJ9.tjRZA06Dka0Fg0K60K9ViQ) and I shared it to the public.
